##Let’s keep leaf size in the family

The identification of the drivers of geographic variation in leaf shape has been a goal of ecology for centuries. In a significant step towards that goal, Wright et al [1] use a large dataset of leaf size to investigate global patterns of leaf size variation in response to climate, and build energy balance models to predict the global upper limits of leaf size. They find that latitude and other climatic gradients capture considerable amounts of variation in leaf size (R2 between 0.12 and 0.28), highlighting the usefulness of this approach for explaining leaf size latitudinal and climactic gradients.
Using the same modelling framework as Wright et al, we find that a combination of site, species, and plant family captures substantially more of the variation in global leaf size than any of the climate variables they analyzed (with values of R2 > 0.94). In fact, a model with family alone as a random effect captures more variation in Leaf Size (R2 = 0.48), and has lower AIC, than any model that just includes individual climate variables as fixed effects. The ‘best’ models (based on AIC) include climate variables as fixed effects, and also site and taxonomic information as random effects [2].
In this instance, non-climatic factors capture more of the variation in global leaf size. Global patterns of leaf size variation appear to represent an amalgamation of disparate patterns among broadly and narrowly distributed plant families [2]. If, as Wright et al propose, the goal is to improve predictions from global vegetation models, or the reconstruction of paleoclimate from macrofossils, in addition to explaining latitudinal gradients, these models should include easily obtained taxonomic information that will help improve predictions at minimal cost.
