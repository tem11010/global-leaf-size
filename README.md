## About this Repository
This repository contains analyses conducted on a dataset obtained from [Wright et al (2017)](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6354/917).


We present the results of generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs), run in R (using the ['lme4'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) package),  examining the response of leaf size to latitude and global climates. 
We demonstrate that taxonomic information captures a significant proportion of global variation in leaf size; even more than climatic variables do.
